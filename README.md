## Python Package Requirements

- Tkinter
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Tabulate


## Description

Tkinter-based GUI to generate playlists based on your current mood from +160.000 Spotify songs.

Please note that the songs are represented in a latent space created by using a VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and the axis representation is open to interpretation. 

This is just a fun project developed to apply some deep learning architectures.


## Usage

### Step 1

Adjust the sliders values according to your current mood and how long you want the playlist to be.

### Step 2

Press the button and generate a new playlist. 
There is some randomness involved on purpose, so you can get different results even if you enter the same values again. 
You won't get the same songs every time!

### Step 3

Enjoy the playlist and I hope you discover some new music!
